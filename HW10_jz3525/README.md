The Assignment 1 was finished individually.

## Assignment 2

I worked with Asilayi Bahetibieke (ab8131) in assignment 2. 

By following the instructions in the skeleton notebook, Asilayi downloaded the dataset, preprocessed the data and merged the dataset.

I plotted the choroplethNYC graphs using the merged dataset, plotted the scatter plots of Units vs Energy consumption, NRG vs Units total and Units total vs NRG. And I fitted the model using linear and quadratic model and plot them on the scatter plot, calculated the chi square and likelihood of the model, made the influence plot, did the likelihood ratio LR test on the model and finished the extra credit part.
