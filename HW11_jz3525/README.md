# PUI2018 HW11

## Assignment 1
Subway timeseries: https://github.com/jzhou60/PUI2018_jz3525/blob/master/HW11_jz3525/HW11_Assignment1.ipynb

I worked with Asilayi Bahetibieke (ab8131) on assignment 1. By follwing the instructions, Asilayi loaded the dataset and plotted the time series in natural and log space and helped detect the events in question 1. I plotted the graph in question 1, analyzed the data and plotted them in question 2, cleaned the data and plotted the standardized plot in question 3.

## Assignment 2

I improved my plot based on the review from Yuchen Ding(yd1402).
