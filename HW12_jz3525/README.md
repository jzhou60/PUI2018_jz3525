# PUI2018 HW12

## Assignment 1
Fourier transform: https://github.com/jzhou60/PUI2018_jz3525/blob/master/HW12_jz3525/HW12_Assignment1_fourier.ipynb

The assignment 1 was completed individually.

## Assignment 2
Time series clustering: https://github.com/jzhou60/PUI2018_jz3525/blob/master/HW12_jz3525/HW12_Assignment2_clustering.ipynb

I worked with Asilayi Bahetibieke (ab8131) for assignment 2. By following the notebook instructions, Asilayi downloaded and preprocessed the dataset, and I trained the KMeans model with n = 5,6,7 seperately with that data, plotted the time series clusters and showed the training labels on the map. Besides, I also trained the dataset with Agglomerative Clustering model with n = 7, plotted the result and plotted the dandrogram graph. After that, I plotted the two clustering models together and tried to interpolate their differences and similarities.
